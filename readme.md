## Controlling my Hue lights in fun ways

This project uses a NodeMCU board, a US 100 distance sensor, a photoresistor, and an LED so I can see where it is at night. It allows me to turn a hue light on and off with a hand swipe. This is useful for getting up at night. There is a second, daytime, mode that uses the photoresistor to automatically adjust the brightness of the lights based on the ambient brightness in the room, like a phone screen does. This helps to keep a certain minimum amount of illumination in the room regardless of how gloomy the day may or may not be.

I have some code for controlling the brightness level with the distance sensor but that has proven to be frustratingly unreliable so I have shelved that feature for the moment.

I don't have a diagram of the circuit at this time.
